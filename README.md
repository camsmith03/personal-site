# Personal Website

My personal site written in ReactJS, configured using Vite, and proxied via nginx over my local self-hosted Debian server.

## Optimizations

Images and Bootstrap CSS/JS files are deferred from prefetching until content is initially loaded to minimize FCP and prevent pop-in on tab switch.
